# Optimization & Technical Debt Strategy

## 🛑 Ignore for now (Fix at the end)

### 1. Validation (Zod)
We will add this once all pages are built. It's just a security layer on top of what we have.

### 4. Delete Safety
We can add a "Are you sure?" popup later. For now, just be careful clicking trash icons!

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
It's an admin dashboard; let's worry about desktop first.

### 6. Manual Clerk IDs
This is a complex task (requiring Webhooks). We will tackle "Real Authentication" as a dedicated chapter after the core features work.

## 🔄 Currently Addressing

### 7. Next.js 15 Params
We already caught this and are fixing it as we go! (`await params`).

## 🔜 To Add Soon

### 3. Loading States
This is very easy to add and will make the app feel much better. After we finish the Schedule, we can add "Saving..." spinners.
